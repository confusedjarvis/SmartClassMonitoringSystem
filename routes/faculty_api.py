# This file is intentionally left empty since we've incorporated all the API endpoints 
# directly into faculty_routes.py to avoid having to manage multiple blueprints.
# 
# The original API endpoints were:
# - /faculty/mark_attendance/<attendance_id>/<status>: For marking students present/absent
# - /faculty/get_students/<timetable_id>: For fetching students for a specific timetable
#
# These are now implemented in faculty_routes.py
